# No Ping 🚫📶

**No Ping** is a fun but meaningful single-page site inspired by [nohello.net](https://nohello.net), made to promote better chat etiquette in developer and online communities.  
Instead of sending a meaningless “ping?” or “hey” and making people wait, this page reminds you to send your full message from the start.

## ✨ Features
- **Minimal, fast-loading design** — just HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JS.
- **Terminal-style look** for a geeky aesthetic.
- **Dynamic console message** (with a friendly "Morning, sweety <3" line).
- Fully responsive for mobile and desktop.

## 💡 How It Works
The site is just one `index.html` file:
- The **main message** is static, telling users what *not* to do.
- A **JavaScript snippet** dynamically adds a friendly line after a short delay to simulate a console printout.
